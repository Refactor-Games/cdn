# Asset CDN Repository

This repository serves as a content delivery network (CDN) for static assets including images and videos. Rather than storing assets directly within application repositories, this approach reduces bundle sizes and improves website load times while maintaining flexibility for content updates.

## üåê GitHub Pages - this is technically a live site

This repository is deployed as a [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) site, however we're only using it to store assets. <br>
The Root URL is:
`https://refactor-games.github.io/cdn/`

## üîó Usage

All assets are accessible via the root URL followed by the file path:
<br>
`https://refactor-games.github.io/cdn/[path-to-asset]`

### Example
For an image located at `images/about-bg.webp`, the full CDN URL would be:
<br>

https://refactor-games.github.io/cdn/images/about-bg.webp

## üìÅ Asset Organization

Assets are organized into directories by type:
- `images/` - Image files (.webp, .jpg, .png)
- `videos/` - Video files (.webm, .mp4)

## üìã Asset Best Practices

- **Images**: Use `.webp` format over `.jpg` or `.png` for better compression and quality
- **Videos**: Use `.webm` format over `.mp4` for improved web performance

## üîÑ Integration with Refactor Website

In the main [Refactor Website](https://github.com/refactorburbs/refactor-website) repository, assets are referenced in two locations:

### CSS Modules
- [About Section Background Image](https://github.com/refactorburbs/refactor-website/blob/main/components/about/about.module.css)
- [All other Sections Background Image](https://github.com/refactorburbs/refactor-website/blob/main/app/globals.css)  
- [LED Overlay Background Image](https://github.com/refactorburbs/refactor-website/blob/main/components/home/ledOverlay.module.css)

### Constants
- [Website-Facing Asset Links](https://github.com/refactorburbs/refactor-website/blob/main/lib/constants/assets.constants.ts)
